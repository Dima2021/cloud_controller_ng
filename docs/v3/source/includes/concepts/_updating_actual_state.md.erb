## Updating Actual State

The Cloud Controller is primarily responsible for the desired state of apps and processes. Most endpoints will
only update the desired states of your apps and processes within Cloud Controller in order
to provide users with the opportunity to incur zero downtime when updating apps. Restarting
the app will be required for the desired state changes to become the actual state.

The [stats endpoint](#get-stats-for-a-process) can be used at any time to determine the actual
(running) state of a process, and by proxy, an app.

#### Endpoints that will affect runtime

The following endpoints will immediately affect runtime:

- `PATCH /v3/spaces/:guid/features/ssh`
- `POST /v3/processes/:guid/actions/scale` (only when updating the instances field)
- `POST /v3/apps/:guid/processes/:type/actions/scale` (only when updating the instances field)
- `DELETE /v3/routes/:guid/destinations/:destination_guid`
- `POST /v3/routes/:guid/destinations` (when not adding a destination with a port)
- `PATCH /v3/routes/:guid/destinations` (when not replacing the port field)

All other changes will not affect running apps until they are [restarted](#restart-an-app).
